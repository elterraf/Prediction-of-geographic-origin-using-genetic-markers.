# Prediction of geographic origin using genetic markers.

The goal of this project is to use genetic markers to predict an individual's geographical origin, which can be "North America," "Central America," or "South America." We will compare classification results using three approaches:
 + multinomial regression
 + linear discriminant analysis (LDA)
 + naive Bayes classifier
